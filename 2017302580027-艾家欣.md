### Problem 6:

> P6. This elementary problem begins to explore propagation delay and transmission delay, two central concepts in data networking. Consider two hosts, A and B, connected by a single link of rate *R* bps. Suppose that the two hosts are separated by *m* meters, and suppose the propagation speed along the link is *s* meters/sec. Host A is to send a packet of size L bits to Host B.        	      
>
> > a. Express the propagation delay, *d*<sub>prop</sub>, in terms of *m* and *s*.
>
> ​         ***Answer:*** *d*<sub>prop</sub> = *m* / *s*
>
> > b. Determine the transmission time of the packet, *d*<sub>trans</sub>, in terms of *L* and *R*.
>
> ​        ***Answer:*** *d*<sub>trans</sub> = *L* / *R*
>
> > c. Ignoring processing and queuing delays, obtain an expression for the end-to-end delay.
>
> ​        ***Answer:*** *d*<sub>end-to-end</sub> = *d*<sub>prop</sub> + *d*<sub>trans</sub> = *m* / *s* + *L* / *R*
>
> > d. Suppose Host A begins to transmit the packet at time t=0. At time t=*d*<sub>trans</sub>, where is the last bit of the packet?
>
> ​        ***Answer:*** At time t=*d*<sub>trans</sub>, the last bit of the packet is at Host A.
>
> > e. Suppose *d*<sub>prop</sub> is greater than *d*<sub>trans</sub>. At time t=*d*<sub>trans</sub>, where is the first bit of the packet?
>
> ​        ***Answer:*** As *d*<sub>prop</sub> > *d*<sub>trans</sub>, at time t=*d*<sub>trans</sub>, the first bit of the packet is              in propagation.
>
> > f. Suppose *d*<sub>prop</sub> is less than *d*<sub>trans</sub>. At time t=*d*<sub>trans</sub>, where is the first bit of the packet?
>
> ​        ***Answer:*** As *d*<sub>prop</sub> < *d*<sub>trans</sub>, at time t=*d*<sub>trans</sub>, the first bit of the packet is at Host B.
>
> > g. Suppose s=2.5x10<sup>8</sup>, L=120bits, and R=56kbps. Find the distance *m* so that *d*<sub>prop</sub> equals *d*<sub>trans</sub>.
>
> ​        ***Answer:*** When *d*<sub>prop</sub> = *d*<sub>trans</sub>, *m* = ( *L* \* *S* ) / *R*= 120 \* 2.5x10<sup>8</sup> / 56000=5.36x10<sup>5</sup> m



### Problem 8:

> P8. Suppose users share a 3 Mbps link. Also suppose each user requires 150 kbps when transmitting, but each user transmits only 10 percent of the time.
>
> > a. When circuit switching is used, how many users can be supported?
>
> ​        ***Answer:*** 3 Mbps / 150 kbps = 20 users can be supported.
>
> > b. For the remainder of this problem, suppose packet switching is used. Find the probability that a given user is transmitting.
>
> ​        ***Answer:*** Suppose packet switching is used. As for each user transmits only 10% of the time, the probability is 0.1.
>
> > c.  Suppose there are 120 users. Find the probability that at any given time, exactly n users are transmitting simultaneously.
>
> ​        ***Answer:*** From the binomial distribution, the propability is:

### Problem 12:

> P12. A packet switch receives a packet and determines the outbound link to which the packet should be forwarded. When the packet arrives, one other packet is halfway done being transmitted on this outbound link and four other packets are waiting to be transmitted. Packets are transmitted in order of arrival. Suppose all packets are 1500 bytes and the link rate is 2 Mbps. What is the queuing delay for the packet? More generally, what is the queuing delay when all packets have length *L*, the transmission rate is *R*, *x* bits of the currently-being-transmitted packet have been transmitted, and *n* packets are already in the queue?
>
> ​       ***Answer:*** There are 4.5 packets in all to be transmitted, so the arriving packet must wait for 4.5\*1500 bytes = 54000 bits to be transmitted. As for the link rate is 2 Mbps, the queueing delay for the packet is 
>
> ​    54000bits / 2Mbps = 27 msec. 
>
> ​    More generally, the queuing delay is [ (*n*+1) \* *L*- *x*] / *R*
