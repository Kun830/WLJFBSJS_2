## Homework 2

### P2

Given the Equation 1.1 dend-to-end = N(L/R), we have the delay for first packet N(L/R).

For the consecutive (P-1) packets after the first one, each have L/R.

Thus, the answer is (N+P-1)L/R.

### P6

a. d_prop=m/s

b. d_trans = L/ R

c. d_end-to-end = m/s + L/R

d. The last bit of the packet is about leaving Host A.

e. The first one has not reached Host B in the link.

f. The first one has reached Host B.

g. m=Ls/R = 120 bit * (2.5*10^8 meters/sec) /(56 * 10^3 bit / sec) = 535.7 km

### P9

a. N_max = 1Gbps / 100kbps = 10^4

b. P(more than N users sending data)= $ SUM_{N=N+1}^{M} p^N *(1-p)^{M-N} $
