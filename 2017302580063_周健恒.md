## Problem 2

T<need> = (N+P-1)\*(L/R). Because the time of first packet being reeceived is N*(L/R), and the time of one more packet being received is L/R. 

## Problem 5

(a)d<sub>prop</sub> = m/s

(b)d<sub>trans</sub> = L/R

(c)d<sub>end2end</sub> = m/s+L/R

(d)The bit is at A, it is going to leave A.

(e)In the link, the distance between the first bit and A is s*d<sub>trans</sub>

(f)In B

(g) m = (L/R)*s= 536KM

## Problem 12

The queuing delay time in this situation is T<need> = 4.5*8 bits*1500/2Mbps = 27msec.
In general, T<queuing_delay> = [(n + 1) * L - x] / R
