## Q1 (P2)

> Equation 1.1 gives a formula for the end-to-end delay of sending one packet of length L over N links of transmission rate R. Generalize this formula for sending P such packets back-toback over the N links.  

The formula for delay should be: L * N * P / R



## Q2(P5)

> Review the car-caravan analogy in Section 1.4 . Assume a propagation speed of 100 km/hour. 
>
> a. Suppose the caravan travels 150 km, beginning in front of one tollbooth, passing through
> a second tollbooth, and finishing just after a third tollbooth. What is the end-to-end delay?
> b. Repeat (a), now assuming that there are eight cars in the caravan instead of ten.  

### a.   When there are 10 cars

The delay from the first booth to the second booth should be: 

10 * 12(s) + 100(km) / 100(km/h) = 62(min)

The delay from the second booth to the third booth should be:

10 * 12(s) + 50(km) / 100(km/h) = 32(min)

So the total delay should be:

62 + 32 = 94(min)

### b. When there are 8 cars

The delay from the first booth to the second booth should be: 

8 * 12(s) + 100(km) / 100(km/h) = 61.6(min)

The delay from the second booth to the third booth should be:

8 * 12(s) + 50(km) / 100(km/h) = 31.6(min)

So the total delay should be:

61.6 + 31.6 = 93.2(min)



## Q3(P20)

> Consider the throughput example corresponding to Figure 1.20(b) . Now suppose that

The throughput should be: min(Rs, Rc, R/M)
