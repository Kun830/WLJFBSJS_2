> Suppose users share a 3 Mbps link. Also suppose each user requires 150 kbps when transmitting, but each user transmits only 10 percent of the time. (See the discussion of packet switching versus circuit switching in Section 1.3 .)
> a. When circuit switching is used, how many users can be supported?
> b. For the remainder of this problem, suppose packet switching is used. Find the probability that a given user is transmitting.
> c. Suppose there are 120 users. Find the probability that at any given time, exactly n users are transmitting simultaneously. (Hint: Use the binomial distribution.)
> d. Find the probability that there are 21 or more users transmitting Â­simultaneously.

**P13**

> a. Suppose N packets arrive simultaneously to a link at which no packets are currently being transmitted or queued. Each packet is of length L and the link has transmission rate R. What is the average queuing delay for the N packets?
> b. Now suppose that N such packets arrive to the link every LN/R seconds. What is the average queuing delay of a packet?

a. (L/R + 2L/R + ....... + (N-1)L/R)/N

= L/(RN) * (1 + 2 + ..... + (N-1))

= L/(RN) * N(N-1)/2

= LN(N-1)/(2RN)

= (N-1)L/(2R)

b. It takes LN / R seconds to transmit the N packets. Thus, the buffer is empty when a each batch of N packets arrive. Thus, the average delay of a packet across all batches is the average delay within one batch, i.e., (N-1)L/2R.

**P22**

> Consider Figure 1.19(b) . Suppose that each link between the server and the client has a packet loss probability p, and the packet loss probabilities for these links are independent. What is the probability that a packet (sent by the server) is successfully received by the receiver? If a packet is lost in the path from the server to the client, then the server will re-transmit the packet. On average, how many times will the server re-transmit the packet in order for the client to successfully receive the packet?

Probability of successfully receiving a packet is: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p_{s}" title="p_{s}" />= (1-p)^N . The number of transmissions needed to be performed until the packet is successfully received by the client is a geometric random variable with success probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p_{s}" title="p_{s}" />. Thus, the average number of transmissions needed is given by: 1/<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p_{s}" title="p_{s}" /> . Then, the average number of re-transmissions needed is given by: 1/<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p_{s}" title="p_{s}" /> -1.
